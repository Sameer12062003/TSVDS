TRAFFIC SIGNAL VIOLATION DETECTION SYSTEM

INTRODUCTION:

The Traffic Signal Violation Detection System is a computer vision-based project aimed at automatically detecting traffic signal violations at intersections. The system utilizes state-of-the-art object detection and image processing techniques to monitor vehicles' behavior and identify potential violations such as red light running and improper lane usage.

FEATURES:

1.Real-time object detection: The system employs deep learning models to detect and track vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects on the road in real-time.

2.Traffic signal violation detection: Using image processing techniques, the system identifies violations, such as vehicles running red lights or making illegal turns.

3.Video recording: The system records videos of detected violations, providing evidence for further analysis and potential law enforcement actions.

4.User-friendly interface: The project comes with an intuitive web-based interface that allows users to visualize the detection results and configure system parameters easily.

HOW IT WORKS:

1.Object Detection: The system uses a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN) to detect vehicles and pedestrians in the video feed.

2.Violation Detection: By analyzing the object positions and traffic signal status, the system determines if a vehicle has violated any traffic rules, such as running a red light or making an illegal turn.

3.Alerts and Video Recording: When a violation is detected, the system triggers an alert and records the video segment of the violation, including the license plate for identification.

4.User Interface: Users can access the system through a web-based interface, where they can view live video streams, review recorded violations, and adjust system settings.
